# Android Coding challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to test the applicant capabilities and, by touching different elements of an existing app, get an idea of how he/she would adapt under different circumstances (existing code, UI, app logic, API communicationâ€¦).

It's based on the architecture, tools and guidelines that we use when developing for the Android platform 

Libraries and tools included:

- [Android support and design](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index.html) (Support-v4/v7/v13/annotations, Appcompat, Recycler view, Card View, Design, Custom tabs, Animated vector drawable and ExifInterface)
- [Google Play services](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview) (GCM, Location, Analytics, Maps, Places and Authentication)
- [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) and [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) 
- [Retrofit 2](http://square.github.io/retrofit/)

## Requirements

- JDK 1.8
- [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
- Min SDK - Android Jelly Bean 4.1 [(API 16)](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/jelly-bean.html)

## Architecture

This project follows badi's Android architecture guidelines that are based on [MVP (Model View Presenter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) and [Clean Architecture](http://fernandocejas.com/2015/07/18/architecting-android-the-evolution/).

It also follows patterns found on [Android Architecture Blueprints sample by Google](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture).

## Code Quality

This project integrates a combination of unit tests, functional test and code analysis tools. 

### Tests

To run **unit** tests on your machine:

``` 
./gradlew test
``` 

To run **functional** tests on connected devices:

``` 
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```
